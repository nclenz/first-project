## Description
This is a simple speed typing game whereby users needs to type as many correct words in a given time.
The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for my first project in General Assembly (Software Engineer Immersive (3 months bootcamp))

<br>


## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: first-project-gavwbhq91-nclenz.vercel.app

<br>

## How To Play
The goal of Speed Typing Game is to score as many points as possible by typing accurately according to the random word shown. 

There is 3 difficulty levels to choose. Which is differentiated by the length of the word and the complexity of the alphabet.

## Approach to Development
I broke down the project into stages:
**Step 1:** Creating the main structure of the game. Producing random words and ensuring the scoreboard is working as expected. 
**Step 2:** Creating different pages and insert timer interval.
**Step 3:** Create difficulty levels and CSS.

After every functions and newly implemented elements, I will run multiple testings to ensure it runs smoothly without bug.

## Key Learnings
1. Make functions small and use meaningful variables and function names. This allows others to read the code easier.

2. Debugging skills. Backtrack the code and logging every steps to locate the bug.
